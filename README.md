# Elevator Pitch
In on terminal, run the rails server `rails `, and in another terminal, run one of the
elevator programs. Either `rake elevators:run_single` for one elevator, or `rake elevators:run_bank`
for a bank of 3 elevators. This program assumes that the elevators[https://github.com/mikeweber/elevators]
repo exists in a neighboring directory. e.g. ~/elevator_pitch and ~/elevators.
